# CONTRACT

A contract refers to the set of rules and specifications that define how the API should be accessed and what kind of data it should return.

The contract defines the endpoints that are available for clients to access, the input parameters and expected responses for each endpoint, and any authentication and authorization requirements that must be met to access the API.
