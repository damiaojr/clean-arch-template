# CONTRACT

A contract refers to the agreement or set of rules that specifies how the API can be used, what functionality it provides, and what kind of data it expects and returns.

The contract defines the interface between the API provider and the API consumer, and it serves as a communication bridge between the two parties. The API provider defines the contract to ensure that the API is used in a consistent and predictable way by its consumers, while the API consumers rely on the contract to understand how to use the API and what to expect in return.

Suppose we have an API that allows users to retrieve information about books. The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /books`: Retrieves a list of all books
- `GET /books/{id}`: Retrieves the details of a specific book identified by its ID
- `POST /books`: Creates a new book
- `PUT /books/{id}`: Updates the details of a specific book identified by its ID
- `DELETE /books/{id}`: Deletes a specific book identified by its ID

```json
{
  "Book": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "id": { "type": "integer" },
      "title": { "type": "string" },
      "author": { "type": "string" },
      "publisher": { "type": "string" }
    }
  },
  "Error": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "code": { "type": "integer" },
      "message": { "type": "string" }
    }
  }
}
```

To integrate with this API using C#, we can use a library such as RestSharp, which provides a simple and intuitive API for sending HTTP requests and handling responses.

```c#
using RestSharp;

var client = new RestClient("https://example.com/api/");
var request = new RestRequest("books", Method.GET);
var response = client.Execute<List<Book>>(request);

if (response.IsSuccessful)
{
    var books = response.Data;
    // Do something with the list of books
}
else
{
    var error = response.Deserialize<Error>();
    // Handle the error
}
```
