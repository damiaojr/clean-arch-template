# APPLICATION

This layer contains the application logic. It handles the CQRS and domain events.

It is dependent on the domain layer, but has no dependencies on any other layer or project.

The persistence layer is accessed by Domain interfaces.

#### CQRS

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern that separates the responsibility of handling commands (i.e., operations that change the state of the system) from that of handling queries (i.e., operations that retrieve data from the system).

In a typical CQRS architecture, the write and read operations are separated into different components or services, with a clear boundary between them. Commands are handled by one or more command handlers, which execute the necessary business logic to perform the operation and update the system state. Queries are handled by one or more query handlers, which retrieve the necessary data from the system and return it to the caller.

Here's a simple example of using CQRS:

```c#
// Define a command class
public class AddProductCommand {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

// Define a command handler class
public class AddProductCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<AddProductCommand> {
    private readonly ProductRepository _repository;

    public AddProductCommandHandler(ProductRepository repository) {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    public async Task<Unit> Handle(AddProductCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken) {
        var product = new Product { Name = request.Name, Price = request.Price };
        await _repository.Add(product);
        return Unit.Value;
    }
}

// Define a query class
public class GetProductsQuery : IRequest<List<Product>> {}

// Define a query handler class
public class GetProductsQueryHandler : IRequestHandler<GetProductsQuery, List<Product>> {
    private readonly ProductRepository _repository;

    public GetProductsQueryHandler(ProductRepository repository) {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    public async Task<List<Product>> Handle(GetProductsQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken) {
        return await _repository.GetAll();
    }
}

// Send a command to add a product
var mediator = new Mediator();
await mediator.Send(new AddProductCommand { Name = "Widget", Price = 9.99 });

// Send a query to retrieve products
var products = await mediator.Send(new GetProductsQuery());
foreach (var product in products) {
    Console.WriteLine(product.Name + " - " + product.Price);
}
```

#### FluentValidation

FluentValidation is a .NET library that provides a fluent API for building strongly-typed validation rules. It allows developers to define complex validation logic in a simple, expressive manner, using a fluent interface that makes it easy to read and understand.

The library supports a wide range of validation rules, such as required fields, string length, regular expressions, comparisons, custom validation logic, and more. It also supports conditional validation, cross-field validation, and integration with popular frameworks such as ASP.NET Core, MVC, and WebAPI.

Here's a simple example of using FluentValidation:

```c#
// Define a class to validate
public class Customer {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

// Define a validator class
public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer> {
    public CustomerValidator() {
        RuleFor(x => x.Name).NotEmpty().Length(1, 50);
        RuleFor(x => x.Age).InclusiveBetween(18, 65);
    }
}

// Validate an instance of the class
var customer = new Customer { Name = "John Smith", Age = 30 };
var validator = new CustomerValidator();
var result = validator.Validate(customer);
if (!result.IsValid) {
    foreach (var error in result.Errors) {
        Console.WriteLine(error.ErrorMessage);
    }
}
```
